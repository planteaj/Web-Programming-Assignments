			<!-- <h2>How to prepare to Shape Up!</h2> -->
			<!-- <h3>Get a check up</h3> -->
			<!-- <p>If you have any health issues or take any medications, be sure to consult with your healthcare -->
			<!-- provider before beginning a new exercise or diet regimen.</p> -->
			<!-- <h3>Dress for Success</h3> -->
			<!-- <p>Workout clothes should be comfy. While exercising, you should be thinking about what you're -->
			<!-- doing, not what you're wearing. That includes good shoes, which are essential for running, -->
			<!-- jogging, or walking, and socks that absorb shock and sweat.</p> -->
			<!-- <h3>Equipment?</h3> -->
			<!-- <p>You don't need to buy a lot of fancy equipment to get in shape. But you might want to invest in a -->
			<!-- yoga mat, a large exercise ball, or some weights, depending on your Shape Up! plan.</p> -->
			<!-- <h3>Resist Temptation</h3> -->
			<!-- <p>It's hard to eat right when everyone else is buying lunch at a fast food restaurant. Invest in some -->
			<!-- good food containers and bring your healthy lunch and snacks. Your body and your wallet will -->
			<!-- thank you.</p> -->
